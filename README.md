I have finish value function iteration with grid search and policy function iteration. 
However, I am still working on the parts related to interpolation.

In CODE file: 
  aiyagari_Grid.m is the value function iteration with grid search
  aiyagari_PFI.m is the policy function iteration
In GRAPHS file:
  Lorenz Curve graph
  Policy function graph
  Time tracking table with VFI and PFI.
HW4_AIYAGARI_REPORT.pdf summarizes the results I have so far.

I hope I can update the interpolation part during the weekends.
